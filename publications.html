              <p class="contCardTitle">Design of an ultrafast pulsed ponderomotive phase plate for cryo-electron tomography</p>
              <p class="description">
                <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.09.491239v1?rss=1">bioRXiv 2022</a> 
                - Ponderomotive phase plates have shown temporally consistent phase contrast is possible within electron microscopes via high fluence static laser modes resonating in Fabry-Perot cavities. Here, we explore using pulsed laser beams as an alternative method of generating high fluences. We find through forward-stepping finite element models that picosecond-or-less interactions are required for meaningful fluences phase shifts, with higher pulse energies and smaller beam waists leading to the predicted higher fluences. An additional model based on quasiclassical assumptions is used to discover the shape of the phase plate by incorporating the oscillatory nature of the electric field. From these results, we find the transient nature of the laser pulses removes the influence of Kapitza-Dirac diffraction patterns that appear in the static resonator cases. The addition of a second laser aligned 90° to the first induces anisotropy to the shape of the phase plate. By incorporating a shifting-electron-beam algorithm, the effects of a finite electron beam crossover are also simulated. A total pulse energy of 8.7 μJ is enough to induce the required π/2 phase shift for Zernike-like phase microscopy. As a brief thought experiment, we also explore the usage of high frequency lasers in a standard electron emission scheme to see if a pulsed electron beam is even necessary. Ultimately, frequency requirements limit the laser to nanosecond pulse durations, causing the required pulse energies to reach unreasonable levels before adequate phase shifts are achieved.

              <p class="contCardTitle">UEMtomaton: A Source-Available Platform to Aid in Start-up of Ultrafast Electron Microscopy Labs</p>
              <p class="description">
                <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304399121000309">ScienceDirect Ultramicroscopy 2021</a>
                - The steady rise in the number of ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) labs, in addition to the opacity and lack of detailed descriptions of current approaches that would enable point-by-point construction, has created an opportunity for sharing common methods and instrumentation for (for example) automating data acquisition to assist in efficient lab start-up and to learn about common and robust protocols. In the spirit of open sharing of methods, we provide here a description of an entry-level method and user interface (UI) for automating UEM experiments, and we provide access to the source code and scripts (source-available) for ease of implementation or as a starting reference point for those entering or seeking to enter the field (https://github.com/CEMSFlannigan/UEMtomaton/releases/tag/v1.0). Core instrumentation and physical connections in the UEM lab at Minnesota are described. Interface communication schemes consisting of duo server-client pairs between critical components – the optical delay stage and the UEM digital camera – are presented, with emphasis placed on describing the logic and communications sequence designed to conduct automated series acquisitions. An application designed and programmed with C++/CLI as Windows Forms in Microsoft Visual Studio – dubbed UEMtomaton – is also presented. Key to the UI layout is centralization of the automation tasks and establishment of communication within the software rather than by interfacing with each individual workstation. It is our hope that this note provides useful insight for current and future UEM researchers, particularly with respect to generalizability and portability of the approach to emerging labs. We note that while this basic, entry-level approach is certainly not the most sophisticated or comprehensive of those currently in use, we feel there is nevertheless value in clearly communicating a proven straightforward method to hopefully lower the barrier to entry into the field.

              <p class="contCardTitle">Imaging phonon dynamics with ultrafast electron microscopy: Kinematical and dynamical simulations</p>
              <p class="description">

                - Ultrafast x-ray and electron scattering techniques have proven to be useful for probing the transient elastic lattice deformations associated with photoexcited coherent acoustic phonons. Indeed, femtosecond electron imaging using an ultrafast electron microscope (UEM) has been used to directly image the influence of nanoscale structural and morphological discontinuities on the emergence, propagation, dispersion, and decay behaviors in a variety of materials. Here, we describe our progress toward the development of methods ultimately aimed at quantifying acoustic-phonon properties from real-space UEM images via conventional image simulation methods extended to the associated strain-wave lattice deformation symmetries and extents. Using a model system consisting of pristine single-crystal Ge and a single, symmetric Lamb-type guided-wave mode, we calculate the transient strain profiles excited in a wedge specimen and then apply both kinematical- and dynamical-scattering methods to simulate the resulting UEM bright-field images. While measurable contrast strengths arising from the phonon wavetrains are found for optimally oriented specimens using both approaches, incorporation of dynamical scattering effects via a multi-slice method returns better qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Contrast strengths arising solely from phonon-induced local lattice deformations are increased by nearly an order of magnitude when incorporating multiple electron scattering effects. We also explicitly demonstrate the effects of changes in global specimen orientation on the observed contrast strength, and we discuss the implications for increasing the sophistication of the model with respect to quantification of phonon properties from UEM images.

              <p class="contCardTitle">Picosecond phase-velocity dispersion of hypersonic phonons imaged with ultrafast electron microscopy</p>
              <p class="description">
                <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.1.073801">APS Physical Review Materials 2017</a>
                - Here, we describe the direct imaging—with four-dimensional ultrafast electron microscopy—of the emergence, evolution, dispersion, and decay of photoexcited, hypersonic coherent acoustic phonons in nanoscale germanium wedges. Coherent strain waves generated via ultrafast in situ photoexcitation were imaged propagating with initial phase velocities of up to 35 km/s across discrete micrometer-scale crystal regions. We observe that, while each wave front travels at a constant velocity, the entire wave train evolves with a time-varying phase-velocity dispersion, displaying a single-exponential decay to the longitudinal speed of sound (5 km/s) and with a mean lifetime of 280 ps. We also find that the wave trains propagate along a single in-plane direction oriented parallel to striations introduced during specimen preparation, independent of crystallographic direction. Elastic-plate modeling indicates the dynamics arise from excitation of a single, symmetric (dilatational) guided acoustic mode. Further, by precisely determining the experiment time-zero position with a plasma-lensing method, we find that wave-front emergence occurs approximately 100 ps after femtosecond photoexcitation, which matches well with Auger recombination times in germanium. We conclude by discussing the similarities between the imaged hypersonic strain-wave dynamics and electron/hole plasma-wave dynamics in strongly photoexcited semiconductors.

              <p class="contCardTitle">Mechanisms of Local Stress Sensing in Multifunctional Polymer Films Using Fluorescent Tetrapod Nanocrystals</p>
              <p class="description">
                <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01907">ACS Nano Letters 2016</a>
                - Nanoscale stress-sensing can be used across fields ranging from detection of incipient cracks in structural mechanics to monitoring forces in biological tissues. We demonstrate how tetrapod quantum dots (tQDs) embedded in block copolymers act as sensors of tensile/compressive stress. Remarkably, tQDs can detect their own composite dispersion and mechanical properties with a switch in optomechanical response when tQDs are in direct contact. Using experimental characterizations, atomistic simulations and finite-element analyses, we show that under tensile stress, densely packed tQDs exhibit a photoluminescence peak shifted to higher energies (“blue-shift”) due to volumetric compressive stress in their core; loosely packed tQDs exhibit a peak shifted to lower energies (“red-shift”) from tensile stress in the core. The stress shifts result from the tQD’s unique branched morphology in which the CdS arms act as antennas that amplify the stress in the CdSe core. Our nanocomposites exhibit excellent cyclability and scalability with no degraded properties of the host polymer. Colloidal tQDs allow sensing in many materials to potentially enable autoresponsive, smart structural nanocomposites that self-predict impending fracture.
